Objective Extension-1
Instead of firing an HTTP GET request to the endpoint, fire a POST request. The data structure
of the content can be freely decided

I have implemented SendHTTPPOST method with payload to provided endpoint, now i can use this method to implementing
the desired logic.

So by switching from a GET to a POST request, we enable the application to send more flexible and structured data.
